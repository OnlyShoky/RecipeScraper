Transfer the crumbs to a large bowl. Stir in the melted butter until well combined. (You can also crush the cookies in a large ziptop bag with a rolling pin until finely ground.)\n2. Press the mixture into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie pan. Freeze for 30 minutes.\nGroupName : For the Filling:\n1. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitting with the whisk attachment, combine cream cheese and peanut butter. Beat on medium speed until smooth and well combined. Scrape down the bowl and add the powdered sugar. Beat just until combined.\n2. In a separate bowl, beat the cream and vanilla until soft peaks form, then fold the whipped cream into the peanut butter mixture. Spoon the filling into the pie crust and smooth into an even layer. Freeze for at least 3 hours or refrigerate for at least 6 hours before slicing.",

Alternatively, set the crust in the refrigerator for an hour.\nCookie-crushing alternative. You can also crush the cookies in a large ziptop bag with a rolling pin until finely ground.\nChill the pie until set. To prevent a runny filling, chill the pie for 3 hours in the freezer or 6 hours in the fridge. The pie can also be made up to a day in advance and chilled right up until serving as well.\nOptional: Switch up the crust. Replace the Oreos with 2 cups of regular or chocolate graham cracker crumbs or chocolate wafer cookies. Increase the butter to ½ cup and add an optional 2 tablespoons of brown sugar for more sweetness. Check out my graham cracker crust recipe for more details. Or, swap the crumb crust altogether for a flaky blind-baked pie crust shell.\nOptional: Use frozen whipped topping. For an even easier filling, skip making homemade whipped cream and use 1 (8-ounce) tub of frozen whipped topping (like Cool Whip), thawed. Just stir it into the filling as directed with the whipped cream.",

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.\n3. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, oil, sugars, and vanilla until lightened in color and smooth.\n4. Add the wet mixture and zucchini to the dry mixture and gently stir until combined and no dry streaks of flour remain. (The batter will be thick. The zucchini will continue to release moisture as the muffins bake.)\n5. Use a triggered ice cream scooper to fill the muffin liners almost all of the way full. Bake for 24 to 26 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean.\n6. Let the muffins cool for 5 minutes in the pan, then transfer them to a wire cooling rack to cool completely.",

                    "notes": "Use room temperature ingredients. Set the eggs out 30 minutes or so before you start baking so they can warm up to room temperature. This will make it easier to incorporate with the other ingredients.\nWeigh the flour. Using too much flour in these muffins will make them dry and crumbly instead of soft and moist. The best way to measure flour is by weighing it with a kitchen scale. If you don’t have one, fluff the flour in its canister and spoon it into your measuring cup. Use a knife to level off the top. Do not scoop directly from the container.\nDon’t over-mix the batter. Your muffins will turn out dense and hard if you stir them excessively. Just mix until the flour is fully incorporated.\nDo not wring the zucchini dry or squeeze out any liquid before adding to the wet ingredients. It provides moisture to the muffins while baking. If you lose this excess moisture, the muffins will be dense, dry, and not very delicious.",

Place the mixture in a 9×13-inch baking dish and press with a flat-bottomed glass or measuring cup to make an even layer.\n3. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until fragrant. Set on a wire rack for about 45 minutes to cool completely.\n4. Once the crust is cool, place the cream cheese and ⅔ cup granulated sugar in a large mixing bowl. Beat on high speed with a hand mixer for about 2 minutes until very smooth. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.\n5. Fold in the thawed whipped topping. Spread the mixture into an even layer over the cooled crust. Refrigerate for 1 hour to set.\n6. In a large bowl, combine the Jell-O and the boiling water. Whisk by hand for 1 to 2 minutes until the Jell-O is fully dissolved. Set aside to cool to room temperature for about 1 hour.\n7. Meanwhile, hull the strawberries and slice them into ¼-inch thick pieces.\n8. Once the cream cheese filling is set, carefully lay the strawberries over top of it, overlapping them slightly. Slowly pour the cooled Jell-O mixture over the strawberries. Refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours until the Jell-O is firmly set. Slice and serve.",

Do not crush them into a powder. Instead, leave some pea-sized pieces to add texture to the crust. You can also pulse them in a food processor until coarsely chopped.\nYou can use a stand mixer to make the cream cheese filling. If you would prefer, use a stand mixer instead of a hand mixer. Beat the cream cheese and sugar on medium speed with a paddle or whisk attachment. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and fold in the cool whip.\nFor clean, neat slices of strawberry pretzel salad, run a sharp knife under hot water and wipe it dry before slicing. Wipe off the knife between cuts and run it under hot water occasionally if slicing several pieces.",

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt.\n3. In a large mixing bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 3 to 4 minutes.\n4. Add the egg and vanilla and beat on medium until well combined.\n5. With the mixer on low, slowly add flour mixture to butter mixture until combined, stopping to scrape down the bowl as needed. Place the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Place a piece of wax or parchment paper over the dough, and press the dough into an even 12-inch circle. (To get a perfectly even cookie crust layer, use a flat spatula, bench scraper, or bowl scraper to help spread your cookie dough onto the pan.) Remove the paper.\n6. Bake for 16 to 18 minutes, or until the edges are lightly browned and a wooden toothpick comes out clean. Let cool completely on the pan.\nGroupName : For the Topping:\n1. In a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese on medium speed until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla. Beat on medium-low until smooth. Spread over cooled cookie crust. Arrange fruit slices in concentric rings of alternating fruits over the frosting. Serve immediately. Refrigerate any leftovers for up to 3 days.",

                    "notes": "If the cookie crust dough is too sticky to work with, chill the dough in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.\nDo not spread the cookie crust too thin. It needs to be sturdy enough to hold up the fruit topping. If you are using a 12” pizza pan, this won’t be an issue!\nLet the crust cool completely before frosting. If it’s still hot, the cream cheese frosting will melt.\nIf you do not have powdered sugar, follow my foolproof guide on how to make powdered sugar.\nSlice the fruit into small, bite-sized pieces or chunks to make the pizza easier to eat.\nUse fresh or canned fruit. Frozen fruit will not have the same texture or flavor. If you use canned fruit, drain the fruit and pat dry with paper towels.",

Remove the chicken, reserving the liquid in the pot, and shred using 2 forks.\n4. If you want to reduce the cooking liquid, turn the Instant Pot onto the “Saute” setting and simmer until the liquid has reduced by about half or your desired consistency, about 10 minutes. Press ‘Cancel’ to the pot off.\n5. Return the shredded chicken to the pot and stir until heated through. Fill tortillas with the shredded chicken and serve with your desired toppings.",

Add the butter and pulse a few times just to break the pieces down a bit.\n2. While pulsing, drizzle in 4 tablespoons of ice water. Pulse until dough starts to clump together. Turn out dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead together to form a ball. Shape into a disk and tightly wrap in plastic wrap. Chill for at least 2 hours or up to 3 days.\nGroupName : For the Apple Filling:\n1. Preheat the oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.\n2. Peel, core, and slice the apples into ⅛-inch thick slices. Place in a large bowl. Toss with lemon juice until well coated.\n3. Sprinkle apples with sugar and cinnamon and toss until combined.\nGroupName : For the Assembly:\n1. On a lightly floured surface, roll pie dough into roughly a 12-inch circle. Transfer to the lined baking sheet (the dough will likely hang over the edges.) Arrange the apple filling in the center of the dough, leaving a 3-inch border. Drizzle the apples with melted butter.\n2. Fold the edges of the dough over the filling towards the center. (The dough will not fully cover the filling). Brush the dough with egg and sprinkle with sugar.\n3. Bake for 45 minutes or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly. Let cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing.",

                    "notes": "To save time: You can use store-bought pie dough instead of making galette dough from scratch.\nWeigh the flour. This is the easiest way to avoid using too much flour, which will yield a dry, crumbly crust. If you don’t have a kitchen scale, fluff your flour with a spoon in its container, spoon it into your measuring cup, and use a knife to level it off.\nIf you don’t have a food processor: Make the dough by hand using a pastry cutter or your hands. Combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the cubed butter and work it into the flour until the mixture is very crumbly. Stir in the water with a fork and gently knead the dough into one large mass. Wrap and chill as directed.\nIf the chilled pie crust dough starts to tear and crack when you’re rolling it out, let it rest for a few minutes at room temperature before trying to roll it again.\nPeel the apples. While not completely necessary, peeling the apples before slicing them makes a world of difference to the texture of the filling once the apples bake. The peels tend to become wrinkly and rubbery in the oven, which I prefer to avoid.\nFor more caramel or molasses notes: Use light brown sugar in the filling in place of granulated sugar.\nDon’t overfill the crust. Lay the apple slices out in an even layer. If there is too much apple filling, the crust may not bake properly and become soggy, and the filling may bubble over.\nRefrigerate the galette once you assemble it: This optional step helps the butter in the pastry dough firm up so that the galette holds its shape nicely and the crust is flaky when baked. It can be refrigerated for up to 2 hours before baking.",

Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes, or until the sugar is dissolved.\n3. Increase the heat to medium-high and cook, swirling occasionally, for about 5 minutes until golden or amber in color. (If sugar crystals form on the side of the pan, use a wet pastry brush to push them down the sides.)\n4. Immediately pour the caramel into an 8-inch round cake pan. Tilt and turn the pan to spread the caramel out to the edges, then set the pan aside to cool and harden while you make the custard. (Be careful- the bottom of the pan will be very hot!)\n5. Combine the eggs, condensed milk, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract in a blender or a large mixing bowl. If blending, blend on low just until combined, and set aside for a few minutes to let any bubbles on the surface settle. If using a mixing bowl, whisk it together until well combined. If the milk mixture if too bubbly in either method, pour it through a fine mesh sieve into to the pan to remove the air bubbles.\n6. Place the pan with the caramel in a roasting pan. Pour the milk mixture directly into the pan over the hardened caramel. Fill the roasting pan with 1 inch of hot water.\n7. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes until the center is just set. (It will wobble slightly when you jiggle the pan but continue to set as it cools.)\n8. Remove the cake pan from the roasting pan. Transfer it to a wire rack and allow it to cool to room temperature before serving. (You can refrigerate the flan if you prefer as well.)\n9. To serve, run a small sharp knife around the edge of the pan then place a serving dish upside down on top. Flip and remove the pan. (If you chilled the flan, dip the pan halfway into a bowl of hot water to warm the caramel before inverting onto a plate.) Slice and serve.",

Wrap 4 to 6 tortillas in a damp paper towel and microwave for 25 seconds. Once heated, cover the tortillas to keep them warm.\n3. Spoon about 1½ tablespoons of the chicken mixture along one edge of each tortilla. Roll up the tortillas tightly.\n4. Preheat the air fryer to 400°F.\n5. Place the taquitos, seam side down, in the air fryer basket, leaving space between them. Spray the tops with cooking spray.\n6. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes or until crispy. Remove the taquitos and keep warm. Continue warming tortillas, filling, and rolling taquitos while each batch cooks.\n7. Serve hot with with guacamole, sour cream, and salsa.",

They will dry out, and the tortillas will start to crack while waiting to be cooked. You can keep them warm in a 200°F oven while each batch cooks.\nWarm up the tortillas to make them pliable. Don’t skip this step! Otherwise, they will break when you start to roll them.\nWrap the taquitos tightly so they do not come apart in the air fryer. Be careful, though, as corn tortillas crack easily.\nPlace the air fryer chicken taquitos seam side down in the air fryer basket. This will ensure they do not fall apart.",

Add the black beans, 6 cups of water, onion, garlic, chili powder, cumin, salt, and oregano to the Instant Pot insert.\n3. Place the lid on the Instant Pot and twist and seal to lock. Turn the steam release valve to “sealing”. Set the Instant Pot to high pressure for 25 minutes. Let steam release naturally, for 25 minutes, then release manually.\n4. Remove the lid from the Instant Pot. Add the lime juice and season with more salt to taste.",

                    "notes": "For thicker black beans, you can drain off the liquid after cooking or mash ½ to 1 cup of the beans and stir them back into the pot.\nTo soften the flavors of the onion and garlic, use the saute function to cook them until starting to brown in 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil before pressure cooking the black beans.\nUse a 6-quart Instant Pot. This is the ideal size for this recipe. If using a smaller Instant Pot, remember that the contents should not pass the max fill line. You may need to scale the recipe down to fit into a smaller pot.",
